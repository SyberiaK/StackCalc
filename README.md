# StackCalc Revived

**StackCalc Revived** is a rewrite of **TomB_134**'s Fabric client mod that can calculate often repeated math tasks while playing **Minecraft** - items to stacks, shulker boxes or double chests. **StackCalc Revived** improves code style and offers some new small QOL features.

## Usage
Open chat and type in whatever number you want, then add `s` suffix (e.g `1234s`) and press `TAB` key.

You can use `sb` or `dc` suffixes to calculate shulker boxes or double chests as well.

**1.1 feature:** You can also change stack limit by typing `-<stack limit>` after the suffix.
